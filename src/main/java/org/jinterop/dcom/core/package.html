            Defines the classes and data structures required to work with j-Interop. It also
            implements the core principles of DCOM specifications .

            A good starting point is to get familiar with {@link org.jinterop.dcom.core.JISession}
            and {@link org.jinterop.dcom.core.JIComServer} classes. They together serve as an
            entry point into the COM world. A quick glance at {@link org.jinterop.dcom.core.IJIComObject}
            would familiarize the user with basic COM APIs.

            The event call back mechanism is implemented by {@link org.jinterop.dcom.core.JILocalCoClass }
            ,{@link org.jinterop.dcom.core.JILocalInterfaceDefinition },{@link org.jinterop.dcom.core.JILocalMethodDescriptor}
            and {@link org.jinterop.dcom.core.JILocalParamsDescriptor }classes.
