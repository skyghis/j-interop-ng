/**
 * Definition from MSDN: <i> encapsulates the CURRENCY data type used in
 * Automation. CURRENCY is implemented as an 8-byte, two's-complement integer
 * value scaled by 10,000. This gives a fixed-point number with 15 digits to the
 * left of the decimal point and 4 digits to the right. The CURRENCY data type
 * is extremely useful for calculations involving money, or for any fixed-point
 * calculation where accuracy is important. It is one of the possible types for
 * the VARIANT data type of Automation.<p>
 *
 * for example :- <br>
 * If the absolute value of the fractional part is greater than 10,000, the
 * appropriate adjustment is made to the units, as shown in the third of the
 * following examples.
 * <p>
 *
 * Note that the units and fractional part are specified by signed long values.
 * The fourth of the following examples shows what happens when the parameters
 * have different signs.
 * <p>
 *
 * COleCurrency curA; // value: 0.0000 <br>
 * curA.SetCurrency(4, 500); // value: 4.0500 <br>
 * curA.SetCurrency(2, 11000); // value: 3.1000 <br>
 * curA.SetCurrency(2, -50); // value: 1.9950 <br>
