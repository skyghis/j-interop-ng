 * Implement this interface receive notifications for <code>IJIComObject</code>s
 * when they get garbage collected. This also means that the actual interface
 * reference on the COM server have a reference count of 0 and will get garbage
 * collected itself by COM runtime.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * One note of caution, the <code>IJIComObject</code> is uniquely identified
 * across the client-server relationship by it's <code>IPID</code>. The
 * <code>IPID</code> should be used as a key to store a relevant "action" object
 * when <code>unReferenced</code> method of this interface is invoked. If the
 * <code>IJIComObject</code> is stored at a place solely for the purpose of this
 * housekeeping than it will <b>NEVER</b> get garbage collected by the framework
 * as the logic of collection is based on weak references.
 *
 * <p>
 * <code>
 * <br>
 * comObject.registerUnreferencedHandler(session, new IJIUnreferenced(){<br>
 * public void unReferenced()<br>
